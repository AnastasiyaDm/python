GitPython provides object model access 
to your git repository. This tutorial is 
composed of multiple sections, most of which 
explains a real-life usecase.

All code presented here originated 
from test_docs.py to assure correctness. 
Knowing this should also allow you to more 
easily run the code for your 
own testing purposes, all you need
 is a developer installation of git-python.
